# Predicting Instructor Performance in Higher Education using Supervised Machine Learning Models 

Four classiﬁcation techniques—decision tree algorithms, support vector machines, artiﬁcial neural networks, and discriminant analysis—are used to build classiﬁer models. 

Their performances are compared over a data set composed of responses of students to a real course evaluation questionnaire using accuracy, precision, recall, and speciﬁcity performance metrics. 

In addition, an analysis of the variable importance and receiver operating characteristic curve, or ROC curve for each classiﬁer model has been generated in order to compare the performances of the classifier models.
